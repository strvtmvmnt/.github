# community contribution docs for nonsensetwice

this repository houses all of the default documentation for all personal open
source projects. this includes:
- code of conduct
- contributing guidelines
- discussion category forms
- issue templates
- governance docs

and more as they're created. these docs will be updated and revised as
necessary over the course of project development. individual projects may
take on different governance approaches; as such, governance docs will be
drafted for those projects specifically, when they arrive at that level.
