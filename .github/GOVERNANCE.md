# governance of nonsensetwice/nonsensecodes projects

## preamble

the purpose of open source projects in the nonsensetwice/nonsensecodes workspaces
are to either fill a void in the development ecosystem or pursue an idea or
concept for the sake of learning and building collaboratively. however, regardless
of the purpose of a project, the overall goal of open source is to work
together to bring a project to fruition. to this end, the following guidelines 
will govern the project.

## hierarchy

projects carry a general hierarchy of users > contributors > maintainers.
maintainers serve contributors, working with writers and developers to build
and/or improve the library, framework, or application. contributors work with
maintainers to provide support for end users. users are the reason a project
continues to exist; often, it is the users that will drive further development
on a project.

accountability flows from the bottom up, creating an inclusive and flexibile 
development environment. while maintainers and moderators are entrusted to
uphold community guidelines and manage community membership in the most severest
of cases, the whole community, generally, works together to bring a project to
success.

## consensus

decisions are made via a consensus mechanism rather than majority vote. while the
process of consensus is generally slower than putting everything to a vote, this
process favors the value provided by every member in a community. furthermore,
a number of community and development benefits arise from consensus:
-   [facilitation](#facilitation)
-   [accountability](#accountability)
-   [inclusivity](#inclusivity)
-   [decentralization](#decentralization)

### facilitation

majority rule mechanisms tend to introduce hard and fast rules around how
a decision may be implemented. this can lead to secondary and tertiary
deleterious effects that may negatively impact the community as a whole.
a consensus-based decision-making process provides rails in which a community
may work together to implement agreed-upon additions or changes. as challenges
arise in the course of implementation, delegated individuals and groups can
rely on the support of the overall community to address these challenges.

### accountability

when the community works together to drive a project forward, accountability is
shared by the entire community, as opposed to a select few making decisions
on behalf of the community at large. with regard to the users > contributors >
maintainers hierarchy, accountability moves from bottom to top, with everyone
working to ensure all effective policies are enacted appropriately.

### inclusivity

consensus-based decision-making ensures that every voice is heard, and that all
decisions are, at minimum, approved by every participating member in a community.

### decentralization

as an extension of inclusivity, consensus-based decision-making disperses power
dynamics across the entire community, rather than concentrating power in the hands
of a few. the entire community revises proposals to arrive at consensus prior
to adopting them. the entire community resolves dissent in a meaningful and
peaceful manner. the entire community manages conflict through meaningful
discourse rather than arbitration.

as stated above, maintainers and moderators are entrusted to uphold community
guidelines in the most severest of cases; however, "the most severest of cases"
are determined by the community. At any time, any member may act in accordance
with the Code of Conduct to address issues that arise that do not require the
community's input or consensus.
